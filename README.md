# Risk-Retention-Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user engagement and retention in a simulated business environment to identify risk factors, churn patterns, and workflow bottlenecks. It demonstrates data-driven decision-making, business process mapping, and dashboard visualization.

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk users likely to churn.
- Analyze engagement trends and retention rates.
- Recommend actionable improvements for product onboarding and feature adoption.
- Build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- Power BI / Tableau
- Git & GitHub

## Dataset
- Sample dataset of user interactions including:
  - User ID
  - Sign-up date
  - Feature usage events
  - Engagement scores
  - Churn indicator (simulated)

## Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Processing using SQL & Python
2. Cohort Analysis & Retention Modeling
3. Risk Analysis to identify churn-prone users
4. KPI Dashboard Creation in Power BI / Tableau
5. Documentation of methodology, process diagrams, and recommendations

## Key Features
- Cohort & funnel analysis
- Risk scoring and retention probability modeling
- Interactive dashboard for leadership insights
- Process mapping to demonstrate workflow improvements

## How to Run
1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `notebooks/risk_retention_analysis.ipynb` for analysis
3. Open `dashboards/retention_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI for visualizations

## Outcome / Impact
- Identified churn risk patterns and engagement bottlenecks
- Provided actionable recommendations to improve retention by 10â€“15%
- Created dashboards enabling real-time KPI tracking and decision-making
